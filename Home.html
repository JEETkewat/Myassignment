Several agencies including the Income Tax Department and the Central Bureau of Investigation are investigating Mallya for charges including financial fraud and money laundering,[54][55][52][56] and the Attorney General said that Mallya's assets abroad are "far in excess to loans taken by him".[52] The 17 banks added a joint petition at the Supreme Court of India in March 2016 to try to prevent Mallya from leaving the country, but the Indian government indicated that he had already left. The Enforcement Directorate of India also filed a money laundering case against him in March 2016 for allegedly sending abroad some ₹9 billion (US$110 million) that had been loaned to his airline.[52]

On 24 April 2016, the Ministry of External Affairs (India) revoked Mallya's passport,[57][58] and he resigned from the Rajya Sabha on 2 May 2016, the day before their Ethics Committee was prepared to recommend his expulsion.[1] Currently the Enforcement Directorate is seeking Interpol to raise an international arrest warrant against Mallya.[59][60] Also, the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya on 13 March 2016 for his failure to appear in the court regarding an allegation of cheating the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd by issuing them a dishonoured cheque for ₹5 million (US$63,000).[61]

On 13 June 2016, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court declared Mallya a "proclaimed offender" on a request by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with its money laundering probe against him in an alleged ₹90 billion (US$1.1 billion) loan default case.[62]

Mallya co-owned the Formula One team Force India from 2007 to 2018. In the middle of the 2018 Formula One season, Sahara Force India went into administration due to financial trouble.[63] In August 2018 the team's assets were purchased by Racing Point F1 Team, and continued to race under the Force India name for the remainder of the 2018 season.[64][65]
